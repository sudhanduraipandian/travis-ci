  # If maven-semantic-release finishes successfully and the current branch is master, upload coverage reports for the

  # initiated the Travis build, the report will not be associated with the commits that maven-semantic-release performed
  # (if it ended up creating a release and the two commits that were a part of that workflow). Therefore, if on master
  # codecov needs to be ran two more times to create codecov reports for the commits made by maven-semantic-release.
