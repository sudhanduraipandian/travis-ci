sudo: required

language: python
python:
 - 3.3 # This is irrelevant, because the virtualenv is not used at all

# FIXME: The minimum requirement for Gramps is Python 3.2, so a test environment
# for Python 3.2 should be added to this environment which is Python 3.3. It
# will not be possible to run coverage under Python 3.2, because coverage is
# Python 3.3 (or above) only.
