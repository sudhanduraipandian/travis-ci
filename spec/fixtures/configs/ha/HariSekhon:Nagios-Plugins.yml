  # this build has thread support
  - "5.24-shrplib"

  #- "5.16"
  # latest Redis cpan module requires Perl >= 5.10
  - "5.10"
  # there is workaround in build now to install older version if latest fails for RHEL5/CentOS5 servers
  # other CPAN modules are broken for Perl 5.8, re-visit
  #- "5.8"

# after_failure doesn't trigger from install failure
# perlbrew and cpanm are not installed without an install section
# using script section will trigger "after_failure" section but this runs everything regardless of failures
# script:
install:
  #- pushd lib
  #- make apt-packages
  #- cpanm --installdeps --notest . || echo CPANM LIB FAILED
  #- popd
  #- make apt-packages
  #- cpanm --installdeps --notest . || echo CPANM FAILED
  # integrated cpanm in to core Makefiles
  # workaround for strange error when building pylib submodule, /usr/local/lib/python2.7, /usr/local/man, /usr/lib/python2.7 etc...
  # can't do /usr/lib, otherwise /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so breaks with "sudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner"
  # 777 causes "Insecure directory in $ENV{PATH} while running with -T switch at lib/HariSekhonUtils.pm line 1316" - nice catch to this hackery by Perl taint security
  #- sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/python /usr/local /usr/lib/python*
  # with 755 perms goes back to "error: could not create '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/markupsafe': Permission denied"
  # chown root still same error... must be because pure python submodules don't sudo in Travis
  #
  # Travis has python install before in $PATH even in Perl builds so need to install PyPI modules here otherwise they're not found, but perms not set correctly on Travis build to do this, better than modifying $PATH to put /usr/bin first which is likely to affect many other things including potentially not find the perlbrew installation first
  - sudo chown -R travis /opt/python /usr/local /usr/lib/python*
