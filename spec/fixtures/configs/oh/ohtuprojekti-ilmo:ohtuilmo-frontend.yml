cache:
  # Use $HOME/.npm explicitly. Travis has a "cache: npm" setting as well, but it
  # only caches the npm cache if the "script" is "npm ci". We run "npm ci" in
  # our Dockerfile. We also need to cache $HOME/.npm so that "npx cypress" is
  # cached.
  directories:
    - '$HOME/.npm'
    - '$HOME/.cache' # should cache Cypress?
